adapt-userLevelGradingBoundaries
================

Extension  

Using learnerAssistant, diffuseAssessments and contrib-assessment along with rollay and bottomnavigation to provide a course progress screen.  

####Requirements
1. Show feedback for diffuseAssessments (feedback based upon predicted/highest results or current result) as results panel  
2. Change contrib-assessment bank quantities based upon diffuseAssessment outcomes  
  
###Dependencies

Required:   
[adapt-assessment-learnerAssistant](https://github.com/cgkineo/adapt-assessment-learnerAssistant)  
[adapt-diffuseAssessment](https://github.com/cgkineo/adapt-diffuseAssessment)  
[adapt-contrib-assessment](https://github.com/cgkineo/adapt-contrib-assessment)  

Optional (for results screen):  
[adapt-pageMenuRouter](https://github.com/cgkineo/adapt-pageMenuRouter)  
[adapt-rollay](https://github.com/cgkineo/adapt-rollay)  
[adapt-bottomnavigation](https://github.com/cgkineo/adapt-rollay)  

###Use
```
Navigate to #/ulgb/results or trigger event Adapt.trigger("userLevelGradingBoundaries:resultsOpen") to open results panel.
Use optional dependencies to show results panel.

Or use just to change contrib-assessment banks based upon diffuseAssessment outcome. No results panel is necessary.

```
